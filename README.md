# Generative AI-Driven Design and Machine Learning Prediction of Inhibitors Targeting Plasmodium falciparum Dihydrofolate Reductase–Thymidylate Synthase.
---
## 🔬 Project Overview
This project integrates generative AI, machine learning, and virtual screening to design and evaluate novel inhibitors against Plasmodium falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite. The pipeline fine-tunes the REINVENT framework to generate chemically diverse and biologically relevant molecules, employing an ML-based architecture to predict inhibition activity. 

The workflow fine-tunes the **REINVENT** model to generate new chemical scaffolds and employs **ML**, to classify compounds as *active* or *inactive*.  

By coupling **generative design** with **activity classification**, this project offers an intelligent cheminformatics framework that accelerates early-stage antimalarial discovery.
